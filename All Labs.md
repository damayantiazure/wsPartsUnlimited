#### [Module 3: Release](#3) 
The build phase of the application lifecycle is about making sure the application is continuously ready *to be* shipped. It is also about making it ready to be shipped by triaging the main branch and keeping the main branch green. Also, the way you build it will depend on how you want to ship it.  In this module we are shipping either the UI or the API independently to the ACR (Azure Container Repository).  Then we use the Infrastructure pipeline to deploy to Ring 0 then Ring 1.

# Exercise 2: Setup Team Structure

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will learn how to setup areas, cadences and teams to **support scaling Agile within your organization**. Areas and teams allow you to distribute work across multiple workstreams. Iterations allow you to set up multiple cadence levels to be used by different teams or group of teams.

The following structure represents the organization structure we will implement during this exercise.

!IMAGE[image11-a.png](image11-a.png)

In the example we will implement:

- The portfolio team will plan to use a **half-yearly** cadence and <span style="color:#ED7D31;">**Epics**</span> boards.  The Portfolio Team develops the strategy, then they create the Epics for the strategy.  The Portfolio Team will review Epics with the Product Owner, or Project Manager, and decompose the Epics down to Features and map these to the Product Road Map.

- The program team will plan to use a **3-sprint increment** and <span style="color:#7030A0;">**Features**</span> boards. The Program Team plans their cadence every three sprints, or every nine weeks.  This will be done by creating a Program Increment, or PI, that will contain three sprints.

- The feature team will plan to use a **3-week sprint** and <span style="color:#4472C4;">**Story**</span> boards.  The Feature Team cadence, or sprint, are three weeks long.  Each sprint is three weeks from Monday to the last Friday of the third week.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Setup the foundation of Agile at Scale in Azure DevOps Services.

    **Iteration 1** rename to +++Sprint 1+++
    
    **Iteration 2** rename to +++Sprint 2+++
    
    **Iteration 3** rename to +++Sprint 3+++

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image4.png](module1-exercise2-image4.png)

1. [] Add 3 more sprints: +++Sprint 4+++, +++Sprint 5+++ and +++Sprint 6+++, by selecting the **hol** node and clicking **New child**.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image5.png](module1-exercise2-image5.png)

1. [] Set the dates for the first 6 sprints. Each sprint will be 3 weeks long. Set the start date of **Sprint 1** to **Monday of the current week, and the end date three weeks later on Friday**.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image6.png](module1-exercise2-image6.png)

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image7.png](module1-exercise2-image7.png)

1. [] Create two more iterations without setting their dates, +++PI 1+++ and +++PI 2+++.

    >[!knowledge] These are just sample names. In a real project you can use any naming convention you prefer. **PI** Refers to **Program Increment**. The  goal is to show hierarchical cadences by moving three sprints into each of the PIs.
    
    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image8.png](module1-exercise2-image8.png)

1. [] Move **Sprint 1**, **Sprint 2**, and **Sprint 3** into **PI 1**, then move **Sprint 4**, **Sprint 5**, and **Sprint 6** into **PI 2**.

    >[!knowledge] To move a sprint, drag and drop the sprint onto PI 1 or PI 2.

1. [] Set the **PI 1** and **PI 2** start and end dates using the included sprints.  For example, **PI 1** will start with the same start date as **Sprint 1** and have the same end date as **Sprint 3**.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image9.png](module1-exercise2-image9.png)

1. [] Add an iteration **FY20 - H1** with a start date of **July 1, 2020** and end date of **December 31, 2020**.  Replace the year with your current year to match.

1. [] Add one more iteration, **FY20 - H2** with a start date of **January 1, 2021** and end date of **June 30, 2021**.  Replace the year with your current year to match.

1. [] Move the PIs (Program Increments) into the half-yearly cadences.  Maintain consistency with the dates.  The PIs should be moved into the half-yearly that encompasses their time period.  It is ok if a PI does not move into a half-yearly completely.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image10.png](module1-exercise2-image10.png)

1. [] Now that the Iterations are configured, it is time to setup the areas.  Click on the **Areas** tab.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image11.png](module1-exercise2-image11.png)

1. [] Select the root area **hol** and use the new child button to create the following Area hierarchy.  You can drag and drop areas onto nodes to create the hierarch just like you did with the Iterations.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image12.png](module1-exercise2-image12.png)

    >[!note] We will now create 3 teams matching the three levels of hierarchies we created in the areas section.

1. [] Click on the **Teams** section under the **General** settings section, then click on **New Team** button.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image13.png](module1-exercise2-image13.png)

1. [] In the new team dialogue use the following information to create the +++Modern Portfolio+++.  Be sure to **uncheck** the box next to the option 'Create an area path with the name of the team'.  We have already created our custom Area path for the project.

    !IMAGE[module1-exercise2-image14.png](module1-exercise2-image14.png)
    
    Make sure that you uncheck the **Create an area path with the name of the team** checkbox, then click on **Create team**.

1. [] Repeat the same steps to create three additional teams:

    1. [] +++CRM Program+++

    1. [] +++Web CRM+++

    1. [] +++Mobile CRM+++

    You should now see the following teams in your list.

# Exercise 3: Create a Local Topic Branch

### Introduction
Once you have created a remote branch in Azure DevOps Services that is tied to your work item, then next step is to create a local topic branch so you can work in isolation for that work item.  You first fetch the changes in your remote repository then checkout that branch.  When you fetch the changes Git updates your refs in your local repository.  When you checkout that branch it is remote tracked to Azure DevOps Services so Git knows which commits go with any particular branch.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a local topic branch

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] The FETCH command will fetch branches and/or tags from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories.
 
1. [] To switch to the remote branch and create a local branch, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    git checkout topics/tb-###
    ```

    > [!ALERT] You must replace ### with your topic branch number.  That number will be the story ID.  Refer to the results of the FETCH command to view the number, then update the command accordingly.

# Exercise 4: Complete the Work Item

### Introduction
Now that work has be complted on the topic branch it is time to use our new process methodology and complete the work item.  By moving the work item into In-Progress Done you communicate to your team that you have met the teams Definition of Done and are waiting for the completion of the pull request.  The Pull Request process will automatically move the work item to the Done column indicating a merge was compelted successfully and a full build with all tests are underway.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Complete a work item

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise4-image5.png](module2-exercise4-image5.png)

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] We are using the Model-View-Controller, or MVC, design pattern to create our Web API project.  The MVC pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers.  The pattern helps to achieve [separation of concerns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#separation-of-concerns). Using this pattern, user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions and/or retireve results of queries.  The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.  For more information please navigate to [Overview of ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.1).

1. [] Copy the following code to the **CustomersController.cs** class.

    ```C#-linenums
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using ModernApiApp.Models;

    namespace ModernApiApp.Controllers
    {
        [Route("api/[controller]")]
        public class CustomersController : ControllerBase
        {
            // GET api/customers
            [HttpGet]
            public IEnumerable<Customer> Get()
            {
                var customers = new List<Customer>();
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                {
                    var customer = new Customer {Id= i+1, Name = $"Customer {i+1}" , Address = $"{(i+1) * 100} Main St" };
                    customers.Add(customer);
                }
                return customers.ToArray();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. [] Save all the changes. Click on **File -> Save All** from Visual Studio Code.

1. [] Switch to the PowerShell window and run the following commands:

    1. [] Change to the ModernApiApp project folder.
        
        ```PowerShell-linenums
        cd ModernApiApp
        ```
    1. [] Build the project.

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        dotnet build
        ```   
    
        >[!alert] By issuing the **dotnet build** command, we are building the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries.  These include the project's code in Intermediate Language (IL) files with a .dll extension.  We will also have a resulting .exe file.
    
    1. [] Run the application and verify it works correctly.
    
        ```PowerShell-linenums
        dotnet run
        ```
    
    !IMAGE[module2-exercise4-image6.png](module2-exercise4-image6.png)


1. [] Navigate to the following url: +++https://localhost:5001/api/customers+++. You may receive a certificate warning.  It is safe to proceed to the webpage past the certificate warning.

1. [] You should get the following results:

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise4-image7.png](module2-exercise4-image7.png)

    > [!NOTE] This demonstrates that your new code changes are working.

1. [] Close your browser window or tab that has your code change results.

1. [] Stop the execution of the API. Return to the Powershell window and press **CTRL + C** a couple of times.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise4-image8.png](module2-exercise4-image8.png)

1. [] Save all your work in Visual Studio Code.

1. [] Commit your changes to the local topic branch.

    1. [] Click on the Integrated Source Control icon on the Activity Bar in Visual Studio Code.  This icon is third from the top on the left side of Visual Studio Code and will have a blue number on it representing the number of changes to commit.

    1. [] Provide a message for the commit: +++Created the Customer Model and Customer Controller+++

    1. [] Commit the changes by clicking the **Commit** button just above the comment input text field.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise4-image9.png](module2-exercise4-image9.png)

1. [] Return to your PowerShell window and press **ENTER**.  The prompt has changed to green indicating the branch you are working on is ahead of its remote, the one on Azure DevOps Services which is tied to the Work Item you created earlier.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise4-image10.png](module2-exercise4-image10.png)

1. [] We must synchronize these two so your local changes are recorded on the remote tracking branch on Azure DevOps Services.  Issue the following command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    git push
    ```

# Exercise 5: Create a Pull Request

### Introduction

In order to merge the work that has been done on the topic branch with the main branch, we will use a Pull Request. Pull requests let your team give feedback on changes in topic branches before merging the code into the main branch. Reviewers can step through the proposed changes, leave comments, vote, and approve or reject the code.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a pull request

# Exercise 6: Approve the Pull Request and Clean-Up Local Branches

### Introduction

In a real project, you will not be approving your own pull requests. However, in this hands-on lab, we will assume that you are able to do so.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Approve pull requests in AZURE DEVOPS

- Clean up local branches using git

### Prerequisites

1.  [Lab 1: Agile at Scale using Azure DevOps Services](#lab-1-agile-at-scale-using-azure-devops-services)

### Tasks

1. [] Go to the **Pull requests** list screen in Azure Repos.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image1.png](module2-exercise6-image1.png)

1. [] Click on the pull request you created in the previous exercise.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image2a.png](module2-exercise6-image2a.png)

1. [] Click on the **Files** tab.  As an approver or peer reviewer, you can review the changes in this Pull Request.  This provides a platform for communication at the code level.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image3a.png](module2-exercise6-image3a.png)

1. [] Ideally, we would want our application to return data from a database.  Enter a code comment on line 18 with the following message: +++Please check with your team and implement a data access project.  We should be returning data from the database for this REST API+++. Click the **Comment** button to submit your message.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image4.png](module2-exercise6-image4.png)

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] The comment you added is now transformed to a task that the pull request submitter can choose to solve or decide not to solve. This communication will be saved with the pull request and can help enhance the quality of the overall code base. For this demonstration, we will choose to solve this later in our sprint by adding a database and data access project to the solution.

1. [] As the submitter, you can now respond to the comments.  We will be implementing a database and data access project later in the sprint. Provide your feedback +++We will implement a data access and database project next week+++, and click on the **Reply & Resolve** button.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image5.png](module2-exercise6-image5.png)

1. [] Look to the top-right of the page, and click on the **Approve** button first, then click on the **Complete** button.  This will complete the Pull Request and merge the code changes you created in your branch to the main branch.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image6a.png](module2-exercise6-image6a.png)

1. [] To complete the merge:

    1. [] choose **Merge (no fast forward)** from the Merge Type drop-down list,
    1. [] check the box next to **Complete associated work items after merging** (this will move your work item to the Resolved status and the Done column on the Web CRM board), and
    1. [] check the box next to **Delete topics/tb-### after merging**.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise6-image7.png](module2-exercise6-image7.png)

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] **Merge (no fast-forward)**
This is the default integration strategy in Azure Repos, GitHub and most other Git providers. It emulates running git merge pr from the main branch. All the individual commits in the pull request branch are preserved as-is, and a new merge commit is created to unite the main branch and the pull request branch.  This strategy is helpful because it illustrates exactly how a developer (or developers) worked on a pull request, including each individual commit along the way. It gives the most insight into how a branch evolves, but since it preserves every commit is may be very verbose.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] **Squash Commit**
Squashing will take the tree thatâs produced in a merge and creates a single new commit with those repository contents. It emulates running git merge pr --squash from the main branch. The resulting commit is not a merge commit; those individual commits that made up the pull request are discarded. When this strategy is used, history is reminiscent of a centralized version control system. Each pull request becomes a single commit in main, and there are no merges, just a simple, straight, linear history. Individual commits are lost, which is best for teams that use âfix upâ commits or do not carefully craft individual commits for review before pushing them.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] **Rebase**
Rebase will take each individual commit in the pull request and cherry-pick them onto the main branch. It emulates running git rebase main on the pull reuqest branch, followed by git merge pr --ff-only on the main branch. When this strategy is used, history is straight and linear, like it is with the âsquashâ option, but each individual commit is retained. This is useful for teams that practice careful commit hygeine, where each individual commit stands on its own.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] **Semi-Linear Merge**
This strategy is the most exotic â itâs a mix of rebase and a merge. First, the commits in the pull request are rebased on top of the main branch. Then those rebased pull requests are merged into main branch. It emulates running git rebase main on the pull request branch, followed by git merge pr --no-ff on the main branch.  Some people think of this as the best of both worlds: individual commits are retained, so that you can see how the work evolved, but instead of just being rebased, a âmerge bubbleâ is shown so that you can immediately see the work in each individual pull request.

1. [] Clean up local branches.  Since branches are short-lived in our workflow, we need to delete them.   Switch to the local main branch (from the PowerShell window) by issuing the following command:

    ```Powershell-linenums
    git checkout main
    ```

1. [] Pull the changes from the remote main branch, which is now ahead of your local main branch, so that your local main branch us up-to-date with the remote:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    git pull
    ```

1. [] Delete the local topic branch. 

    >[!alert] Use the right branch name from your session.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    git branch -d topics/tb-###
    ```

1. [] Delete the remote tracking branch.

    >[!alert] Remember to type **origin/** in front of your branch name.

    ```Powershell-linenums
    git branch -dr origin/topics/tb-###
    ```

# Exercise 7: Add Docker Support

### Introduction

Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its environment, solving the âit works on my machineâ headache.  In this exercise we will implement Docker containers to isolate ourselves and introduce a platform for continuous integration, shift-left testing, and agility in our development cycle.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Add docker support
- Build and test a Docker container

### Tasks

1. [] Return to the Web CRM Team board

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image1.png](module2-exercise7-image1.png)

1. [] In the Backlog column, click on **+ New Item**, and create a work item titled +++Add Docker Support+++

1. [] Move the **Add Docker Support** work item to the Planned column.  It will be assigned to you and be set in the current sprint.

1. [] Move the **Add Docker Support** work item to In Progress - Doing column.  This action communicates what work you are currently implementing.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Typically a team will decide on a work flow process that works for them.  In this method, we will *pull* work into *doing* and *push* completed work into *done*.  This allows for visual communication about what a team member has completed, but is waiting on a pull request to complete or a test to complete for the work item to finally be automatically moved into the Done column.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image2.png](module2-exercise7-image2.png)

1. [] Click on the **Add Docker Support** work item

1. [] Under the Development section located on the right-side of the work item, click on **create a branch** to create a topic branch.

    > [!ALERT] Take note of your work item ID.  This is found in the top-left corner of the work item.  When we create a topic branch, we use the naming convention of 'topics/tb-###' where ### is the ID of the work item.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image3a.png](module2-exercise7-image3a.png)

1. [] Return to your PowerShell session and fetch the new branch.

    1. [] Fetch, or ask, your remote (Azure DevOps Services) of there are any new branches.  Make sure you are in the **c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution\ModernApiApp** folder.
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution\ModernApiApp'
    git fetch
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image4a.png](module2-exercise7-image4a.png)

1. [] Checkout the remote topic branch.  This will create a local branch on your computer with the same name

    1. [] Checkout remote topic branch
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    git checkout topics/tb-###
    ```
    > [!ALERT] Remember to use your topic branch name from step 6

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image5a.png](module2-exercise7-image5a.png)

1. [] Return to Visual Studio Code

1. [] Create a file named +++Dockerfile+++ in the **ModernApiApp** project folder.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] A Dockerfile defines the contents and startup behavior of a single container.  Our ModernApiApp will be a container.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image6.png](module2-exercise7-image6.png)

1. [] Copy the following content into it:

    ```Docker
    # See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ for command reference

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1 AS base
    WORKDIR /app
    EXPOSE 80
    EXPOSE 443

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY ["ModernApiApp.csproj", "./"]
    RUN dotnet restore "./ModernApiApp.csproj"
    RUN mkdir "C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\NuGetFallbackFolder"
    COPY . .
    WORKDIR "/src/."
    RUN dotnet build "ModernApiApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

    FROM build as publish
    RUN dotnet publish "ModernApiApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

    FROM base as final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "ModernApiApp.dll" ]
    ```

1. [] Create a **.dockerignore** file to help with the size of the containers.  Just like the .gitignore, the .dockerignore file will not copy unecessary files to the resulting container.

    1. [] Add a new file named +++.dockerignore+++

    1. [] Add the following lines into your **.dockerignore** file

        ```Docker-linenums
        **/.classpath
        **/.dockerignore
        **/.env
        **/.git
        **/.gitignore
        **/.project
        **/.settings
        **/.toolstarget
        **/.vs
        **/.vscode
        **/*.*proj.user
        **/*.dbmdl
        **/*.jfm
        **/azds.yaml
        **/bin
        **/charts
        **/docker-compose*
        **/Dockerfile*
        **/node_modules
        **/npm-debug.log
        **/obj
        **/secrets.dev.yaml
        **/values.dev.yaml
        README.md
        ```

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image7.png](module2-exercise7-image7.png)

1. [] Right-click on the Dockerfile, then left-click on **Build Image...** in the context menu.  This will use the integrated Docker extension to build a Docker image.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image8.png](module2-exercise7-image8.png)

1. [] After left-clicking on **Build Image...**, immediately look to the top-middle (Command Window) of Visual Studio Code.  Press ENTER to accept the default tag.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image9.png](module2-exercise7-image9.png)

1. [] The container is built and ready when you see **"Successfully built..."** and **"Successfully tagged ..."** messages at the end of the process.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image10.png](module2-exercise7-image10.png)

1. [] Using your PowerShell window, run the following command.  Wait for the prompt to return, then you are safe to open a browser and test your container.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name modernapiapp modernapiapp
    ```

1. [] Open a browser and navigate to +++http://localhost:8080/api/customers+++ to test your application is returning data from within the Docker container.  Once tested successfully, close your browser window or tab.

1. [] Stop and remove your Docker containers.  We will continue to build new ones as we add more functionality to the project.

    1. [] Stop all running Docker containers

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
    ```

    1. [] Remove all Docker containers

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
    ```

1. [] From your PowerShell session, stage, commit, and push your changes:

    1. [] Stage your changes in Git using:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution\ModernApiApp
        git add *
        ```
    1. [] Commit the changes to the topic branch:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git commit -m 'Created Dockerfile and .dockerignore file'
        ```

    1. [] Push the changes to the remote topic branch:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git push
        ```

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image11.png](module2-exercise7-image11.png)

1. [] We have tested our container and it is returning data.  Keeping to our work item workflow, return to Azure DevOps Services and *push* your work item into **In Progress - Done** column.  This signals that you have completed this action and are now waiting for tests, pull requests, or other actions that will move your work item to Done.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image14.png](module2-exercise7-image14.png)

1. [] Create a new pull request for your changes. In Azure DevOps Services, click on **Repos** section then click on Files.  Click on **Create a pull request** button to start the process, then click on the **Create** button in the next page.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image12.png](module2-exercise7-image12.png)

1. [] Complete the pull request by clicking on **Approve**, then **Complete** to merge the changes to the main branch.  By clicking on **Approve** then **Complete** you are acting as a peer reviewer or code reviewer.  This action also moves your work item into the Done column on your board.

    !IMAGE[module2-exercise7-image13a.png](module2-exercise7-image13a.png)

1. [] Clean up your local branches after you complete the pull request

    1. [] Switch from your local branch to your main branch.
    
        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git checkout main
        ```

    1. [] At this point all your work has been on the topic branch which has now been merged into the remote main branch.  Your local main branch is now behind the remote main branch.  You must *pull* the changes that have been merged into the remote main to your local main.

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git pull
        ```
    
    1. [] Delete your local branch

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git branch -d topics/tb-###
        ```
        > [!ALERT] Use your topic branch number.  ### will be the work item ID.
    
    1. [] Delete your remote tracking

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git branch -dr origin/topics/tb-##
        ```
        > [!ALERT] Use your topic branch number.  ### will be the work item ID.

1. [] In your PowerShell session, fetch the new branch.

    1. [] Fetch, or ask, your remote (Azure DevOps Services) of there are any new branches.  Make sure you are in the **c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution** folder.
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution

    ```
    > [!ALERT] Remember to use your topic branch name from step 6

1. [] Create a new test project in the **c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution** folder.  We will use this project to write tests.  These tests will exercise code we write in the **ModernApiApp** project folder and help us with higher quality code.

    1. [] Create the test project

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
        dotnet new mstest --name ModernApiApp.Tests
        rm c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution\ModernApiApp.Tests\UnitTest1.cs
        ```

1. [] Verify **ModernApiApp.Tests** and **ModernApiApp** projects build successfully. Open a PowerShell window and use the following commands.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
    dotnet add .\ModernApiApp.Tests\ModernApiApp.Tests.csproj reference .\ModernApiApp\ModernApiApp.csproj

[Return to Module 2 Table of Contents](#toc2)  
[Return to Lab Table of Contents](#0)  

### Tasks

1. [] Return to Visual Studio Code and create a new file named +++CustomersControllerTests.cs+++ in the root of the **ModernApiApp.Tests** project folder.  This file will host all the unit tests for the customers controller that is found in the ModernApiApp project folder.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise2-image5.png](module2-lab3-exercise2-image5.png)

1. [] Add the following code in the **CustomersControllerTests.cs** file. This contains a method named **TestGetCustomerById\_ShouldReturnAValidCustomerWhenGivenAValidId** which will "call upon" the CustomersController.cs file in the **ModernApiApp** project.

    ```CustomersControllerTests.cs
    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
    using ModernApiApp.Controllers;

    namespace ModernApiApp.Tests
    {
        [TestClass]
        public class CustomersControllerTests
        { 
            [TestMethod]
            public void TestGetCustomerById_ShouldReturnAValidCustomerWhenGivenAValidId()
            {
                //Arrange
                var customersControllerUnderTest = new CustomersController();
                const int idUnderTest = 1;
                //Act
                var returnedResult = customersControllerUnderTest.GetById(idUnderTest);
                //Assert
                Assert.IsNotNull(returnedResult, $"The GetbyId method didn't return any customer for ID= {idUnderTest}");
                Assert.AreEqual(typeof(ModernApiApp.Models.Customer),returnedResult.GetType(),$"The GetbyId method returned the wrong type, {returnedResult.GetType().ToString()} instead of {typeof(ModernApiApp.Models.Customer)}");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. [] The Visual Studio Code problem detector will indicate that the method **GetById()** does not exist in the CustomersController.cs file found in the ModernApiApp project folder.  This is a "early warning" system indicating that we should correct these issues before proceding.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise2-image6.png](module2-lab3-exercise2-image6.png)

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Here we are witnessing how test driven development becomes the outline of the program.  Asking for a method to test our customers controller when that method does not exist means we need to create this method.  It is a way that we develop an application based on how we would like to test.

1. [] Go to the CustomersController.cs file found in the **ModernApiApp** project, and add the GetById() method:

    ```CustomersController.cs
    [HttpGet]
    public Object GetById(int id)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise2-image8.png](module2-lab3-exercise2-image8.png)

1. [] Save all your changes in Visual Studio Code.  Click on **File** -> **Save All** in Visual Studio Code.

1. [] From the PowerShell window, run the following commands to build the **ModernApiApp**, **ModernApiApp.Tests** projects and run the unit test:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
    dotnet build ModernApiApp/ModernApiApp.csproj
    dotnet build ModernApiApp.Tests/ModernApiApp.Tests.csproj
    dotnet test ModernApiApp.Tests/ModernApiApp.Tests.csproj
    ``` 

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise2-image9.png](module2-lab3-exercise2-image9.png)

    >[!note] This test is now failing because the code is returning an exception. This is the exception that we have put in place to remind us that we haven't yet written the necessary code for the method.

1. [] Replace the **GetById()** method in the **CustomersController.cs** file with the following code.  This file will be open in Visual Studio Code.

    ```CustomersController.cs
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetById(int id)
    {
        Customer customer = null;
        if (id > 0)
        {
            customer = new Customer(){Id= id, Name = $"Customer {id }" , Address = $"{(id) * 100} Main St"  };
        }
        return new ObjectResult(customer);
    }
    ```

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] We are now removing the *throw new NotImplementedException()* with code that will begin to test our CustomersController.cs controller.  Once we have changed the GetById() method to return a Customer, we need to update our unit tests as well.

1. [] Replace the unit test code in the **CustomersControllerTests.cs** file with the following code.  You can find the **CustomersControllerTests.cs** file in the **c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution\ModernApiApp.Tests** project folder.

    1. [] Update the using statements in the CustomersControllerTests.cs file and add the lines below

        ```CustomersControllerTests.cs
        using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
        using ModernApiApp.Models;
        ```
    
    1. [] Replace the existing **TestGetCustomerById_ShouldReturnAValidCustomerWhenGivenAValidId()** method with the following code:

        ```CustomersControllerTests.cs
        [TestMethod]
        public void TestGetCustomerById_ShouldReturnAValidCustomerWhenGivenAValidId()
        {
            //Arrange
            var customersControllerUnderTest = new CustomersController();
            const int idUnderTest = 1;
            //Act
            var returnedResult = customersControllerUnderTest.GetById(idUnderTest);
            //Assert
            Assert.IsNotNull(returnedResult, $"The GetbyId method didn't return any customer for ID= {idUnderTest}");
            Assert.AreEqual(returnedResult.GetType(), typeof(ObjectResult),
            $"The GetbyId returned type: {returnedResult.GetType()} instead of {typeof(ObjectResult)}" );
            Assert.IsInstanceOfType((returnedResult as ObjectResult).Value, typeof(Customer), 
            $"The object result returned GetbyId contains type: {(returnedResult as ObjectResult).Value.GetType()} instead of {typeof(Customer)}");
            Customer returnedCustomer = (Customer)(returnedResult as ObjectResult).Value;
            Assert.AreEqual(idUnderTest, returnedCustomer.Id,
            $"The customer result returned GetbyId has Id: {returnedCustomer.Id} instead of {idUnderTest}");
        }

# Exercise 3: Dependency Injection

### Introduction

The project you are currently uses simple code but it is hard to test because of dependencies. We will implement the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies.

Dependency inversion is a key part of building loosely coupled applications, since implementation details can be written to depend on and implement higher-level abstractions, rather than the other way around. The resulting applications are more **testable**, **modular**, and **maintainable** as a result. The practice of dependency injection is made possible by following the dependency inversion principle.

Consider the following line of code in your CustomersControllerTests.cs file, which is how the tests starts:

```-nocopy
var customersControllerUnderTest = new CustomersController();
```

Every time you instantiate a new customers controller, all its dependencies have to be instantiated. This means that the unit test might have a dependency on a real database connection, a web service connection, or another system dependency. It also means that there might be a dependency on specific data in the database. There are few disadvantages to this approach:

- Unit tests take longer to run,

- unit tests running on a build server will need access to a database server, and

- data can get corrupted if multiple tests are modifying it.

In addition, this is an example with one dependency only. If your application had more dependencies, then setting up tests becomes even harder.

Let's implement dependency injection into our project and our tests. The goal from covering it in this hands-on lab is to realize the value it adds to make your code more **testable**.

We will add few things to the solution:

- A **data access project** containing an entity framework core data context, a Repository implementation and a Unit of work implementation.

- An **entities project** containing the models that will be served by our Api.

Instead of having you do a lot of typing, we have provided you with all the required code. You will then extend the provided code by adding more tests.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand and use dependency injection

### Tasks

1. [] Return to the Web CRM Team board

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise3-image1.png](module2-lab3-exercise3-image1.png)

1. [] In the Backlog column, click on **+ New Item**, and create a work item titled +++Create Database and Data Access Project+++

1. [] Move the **Create Database and Data Access Project** work item to the Planned column.  It will be assigned to you and be set in the current sprint.

1. [] Move the **Create Database and Data Access Project** work item to In Progress - Doing column.  This action communicates what work you are currently implementing.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] We will *pull* work into *doing* and *push* completed work into *done*.  This allows for visual communication about what a team member has completed, but is waiting on a pull request to complete or a test to complete for the work item to finally be automatically moved into the Done column.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise3-image2.png](module2-lab3-exercise3-image2.png)

1. [] Click on the **Create Database and Data Access Project** work item

1. [] Under the Development section located on the right-side of the work item, click on **create a branch** to create a topic branch.

    > [!ALERT] Take note of your work item ID.  This is found in the top-left corner of the work item.  When we create a topic branch, we use the naming convention of 'topics/tb-###' where ### is the ID of the work item.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise3-image3a.png](module2-lab3-exercise3-image3a.png)

1. [] In your PowerShell session, fetch the new branch.

    1. [] Fetch, or ask, your remote (Azure DevOps Services) of there are any new branches.  Make sure you are in the **c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution** folder.
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
    git fetch
    ```

1. [] Checkout the remote topic branch.  This will create a local branch on your computer with the same name

    1. [] Checkout remote topic branch
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    git checkout topics/tb-###
    ```
    > [!ALERT] Remember to use your topic branch name from step 6

1. [] We will add the necessary projects to your solution that will bring in a database.  Issue the following command to copy a prepared solution over your existing solution from the lab material folder:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    cd c:\hol
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\Exercise 3 - Dependency Injection\ModernApiAppSolution' -Destination 'c:\hol\' -Force -Recurse
    cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
    ```

1. [] Run the following script to restore all the projects you have copied

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    .\restoreApiSolutionLocally.ps1
    ```
    
    !IMAGE[](media/image148.png#eighty)

1. [] Stop and remove all running containers

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
    ```

1. [] Use the following command to build the docker images required for the application and run them as containers.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker-compose -f 'dc.ApiApp.yml' up -d --build
    ```

    >[!note] This command builds two containers, one for the API application and one for the SQL database and opens all the required ports so that the two containers can exchange data.

1. [] You can review your containers by issuing the following command

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker ps
    ```

    !IMAGE[](media/image149.png#eighty)

1. [] Navigate to +++http://localhost:8080/api/customers+++.  You should return a list of five customers.

1. [] Stop the composed infrastructure (containers and network).

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
    ```

1. [] From your PowerShell session, stage, commit, and push your changes:

    1. [] Stage your changes in Git using:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
        git add *
        ```
    1. [] Commit the changes to the topic branch:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git commit -m 'Included Database and Data Access Projects to the Solution'
        ```

    1. [] Push the changes to the remote topic branch:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git push
        ```

1. [] We have tested our database and data access project in the solution. We also have successfully implemented dependency injection letting us test our API without having to run the container.  Keeping to our work item workflow, return to Azure DevOps Services and *push* your work item into **In Progress - Done** column.  This signals that you have completed this action and are now waiting for tests, pull requests, or other actions that will move your work item to Done.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise3-image4.png](module2-lab3-exercise3-image4.png)

1. [] Create a new pull request for your changes. In Azure DevOps Services, click on **Repos** section then click on Files.  Click on **Create a pull request** button to start the process, then click on the **Create** button in the next page.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise3-image5.png](module2-lab3-exercise3-image5.png)

1. [] Complete the pull request by clicking on **Approve**, then **Complete** to merge the changes to the main branch.  By clicking on **Approve** then **Complete** you are acting as a peer reviewer or code reviewer.  This action also moves your work item into the Done column on your board.

1. [] Clean up your local branches after you complete the pull request

    1. [] Switch from your local branch to your main branch
    
        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git checkout main
        ```

    1. [] At this point all your work has been on the topic branch which has now been merged into the remote main branch.  Your local main branch is now behind the remote main branch.  You must *pull* the changes that have been merged into the remote main to your local main.

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git pull
        ```
    
    1. [] Delete your local branch

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git branch -d topics/tb-###
        ```
        > [!ALERT] Use your topic branch number.  ### will be the work item ID.
    
    1. [] Delete your remote tracking

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git branch -dr origin/topics/tb-##
        ```
        > [!ALERT] Use your topic branch number.  ### will be the work item ID.

1. [] Return to Visual Studio Code

1. [] Expand the **ModernApiApp.DataAccess** project files.

1. [] Open and examine the **ApiContext.cs** file.

    ```ModernApiApp.DataAccess-nocopy
    public partial class ApiContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
        public ApiContext()
        {
        }
        public ApiContext(DbContextOptions<ApiContext> options) : base(options) { }
    }
    ```

    >[!note] This class defines the entity framework datacontext which is the class that manages the communication with the database. The class however doesn't know where the database is and will get that information at runtime. This allows us to swap a database for each environment and allows us to use in memory databases as well, while keeping the same data schema.

1. [] Open and examine the **IRepository.cs** file.

    ```IRepository.cs-nocopy
    public interface IRepository<TEntity> where TEntity : class
    {
        void Delete(TEntity entity);
        void Edit(TEntity entity);
        IQueryable<TEntity> GetAll();
        Task<TEntity> GetByIdAsync(int id);
        void Add(TEntity entity);
        IQueryable<TEntity> SearchFor(System.Linq.Expressions.Expression<Func<TEntity, bool>> predicate);
    }
    ```

    >[!note] This class defines the database operations that will be exposed to the other application layers. It is also generic, allowing it to be used with any entity (data table). This approach allows us to unify the way we communicate with any database entity. Hence minimizing the code we have to test for data access, and making sure enhancements or bug fixes to this class positively impact the overall project.

1. [] Open the file **IUnitOfWork.cs**.

    ```IUnitOfWork.cs-nocopy
    public interface IUnitOfWork<TDbContext> where TDbContext : DbContext, new()
    {
        TDbContext DbContext { get; }
        System.Threading.Tasks.Task<int> SaveAsync();
    }
    ```

    >[!note] This interface defines the unit of work operations which include persisting any operations performed by one or many repositories. It allows our database operations to be atomic.

    >[!knowledge]For more information on the Repository and Unit of Work design patterns, refer to the following:       [https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html)
    >
    [https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html)

1. [] Expand the **ModernApiApp** project files.

1. [] Open the **Startup.cs** file.

    ```Startup.cs-nocopy
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }
    
    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        var connectionString = buildConnectionString();
        services.AddDbContext<ApiContext>(options =>   options.UseSqlServer(
                                connectionString,
                                b => b.MigrationsAssembly("ModernApiApp")
                                )
                            );
        services.AddTransient<IUnitOfWork<ApiContext>, UnitOfWork<ApiContext>>();
        services.AddMvc();
    }
    ```

    >[!note] Notice how in the ConfigureServices method, we register an ApiContext, we ask it to use SQL server and we give it a connection string. Any other class in the project that needs an ApiContext will simply ask for one, without needing to know of the details about what kind of database it is or where it is. This is an example of the concept of dependency injection.
    >
    Notice also how the buildConnectionString method builds a connectionString to the database, by **reading environment variables**. This allows secrets to be **stored within the environment** itself and allow us to easily **swap those secrets** during our release process.

1. [] Open the **CustomersController.cs** under the Controllers folder.

    ```CustomersController.cs-nocopy
    [Produces("application/json")]
    [Route("api/Customers")]
    public class CustomersController : Controller
    {
        IUnitOfWork<ApiContext> _uow;
        IRepository<Customer> _customerRepository;
        public CustomersController(IUnitOfWork<ApiContext> uow)
        {
            _uow = uow;
            _customerRepository = new Repository<Customer>(_uow.DbContext);
        }
        // GET api/customers
        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable<Customer> Get()
        {
            var customers = _customerRepository.GetAll().Take(10); 
            return customers.ToArray();
        }
        public IActionResult GetById(int id)
        {
            Customer customer = null;
            if (id > 0)
            {
                customer = new Customer() { Id = id, Name = $"Customer {id }", Address = $"{(id) * 100} Main St" };
            }
            return new ObjectResult(customer);
        }
    }
    ```

    >[!note] Notice how the controller simply expresses that it needs a UnitOfWork class containing an ApiContext, which will handle data persistence. It relies on **dependency injection**, to find the implementation in the services we registered in the **Startup.cs** class. The rest of the data access operations aren't aware of any of this injection.
    >
    The advantage of using such a pattern is that it allows to inject or swap the database context at runtime, which means that in our tests we will not need to use a real database.

1. [] Expand the **ModernApiApp.Tests** project files.

1. [] Open the **Stubs.cs** file in the **Mocks** folder.

    ```Stubs.cs-nocopy
    public static IUnitOfWork<ApiContext> setUpUnitOfWorkMock()
    {
        var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ApiContext>()
            .UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: "InMemoryApiAppDatabase")
            .Options;
        _apiContext = new ApiContext(options);
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
            _apiContext.Customers.Add(new Customer { Id = i + 1, Name = $"Name {i}", Address = $"{(i + 1) * 10} main street" });
        }
        _apiContext.SaveChanges();
        var uow = new UnitOfWork<ApiContext>(_apiContext);
        return uow;
    }
    ```

    >[!note] This method generates an IUnitWork for the ApiContext class that uses an entity framework in memory database.

1. [] Open the **CustomersControllerTests.cs** file.

    ```CustomersControllerTests.cs-nocopy
        using System.Linq;
        using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
        using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

                public CustomersControllerTests() {
                    _uow = Stubs.setUpUnitOfWorkMock();
                    _customerRepository = new Repository<Customer>(_uow.DbContext);

                    int idUnderTest = _customerRepository.GetAll().FirstOrDefault().Id;
                    //Act
                    var returnedResult = customersControllerUnderTest.GetById (idUnderTest);

                    Assert.IsNotNull(returnedResult, $"The GetbyId method didn't return any customer for ID={idUnderTest}");
                    Assert.AreEqual(returnedResult.GetType(), typeof(OkObjectResult),$"The GetbyId returned type: {returnedResult.GetType()} instead of {typeof(OkObjectResult)}");
                    Assert.IsInstanceOfType((returnedResult as OkObjectResult).Value, typeof(Customer),$"The object result returned GetbyId contains type: {(returnedResult as OkObjectResult).Value.GetType()} instead of {typeof(Customer)}");
                    Customer returnedCustomer = (Customer)(returnedResult as OkObjectResult).Value;
                    Assert.AreEqual(idUnderTest, returnedCustomer.Id,$"The customer result returned GetbyId has Id: {returnedCustomer.Id} instead of {idUnderTest}");
                }
            }
        }
    ```

    >[!note] Notice how we inject by not having to worry about having a real database with real data at test time.
    
    >[!help] If this concept is still unclear, please ask your instructor to walk you through the code.

1. [] From your PowerShell, execute the following commands:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    cd c:\hol\ModernApiAppSolution
    dotnet test ModernApiApp.Tests\ModernApiApp.Tests.csproj

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image1.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image1.png)

1. [] Initialize a git repository in that folder, stage all files, and commit them locally.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution\'
    git init
    git add *
    git commit -m 'Created UI Project'
    ```
   
1. [] Return to your Azure DevOps Services.  Click on **Project Settings** found in the lower left part of the page, then locate the **Repos** section and click on **Repositories**.  Add another repository named +++ModernUIAppRepository+++.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image3.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image3.png)

1. [] Push the code from your local **ModernUIAppSolution** folder to the **ModernUIAppRepository** on Azure DevOps Services.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution'
    git remote add origin https://Student1-@lab.LabInstance.Id@dev.azure.com/Student1-@lab.LabInstance.Id/hol/_git/ModernUIAppRepository
    git push -u origin --all
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image4a.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image4a.png)

    >[!note]With two repositories in a parent folder containing all the code you may need, you can easily switch between working on the database, the REST API, or the UI, and  preserve modularity by having distinct repositories.
    >
    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image5a.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image5a.png)
    >
    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image6.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image6.png)
    >
    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image7.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image7.png)
    >

    >[!NOTE] The web application will retrieve customer's data from the REST API you've built in the previous exercises and display it in web view. Our **first step** will be to capture this requirement.

1. [] To help with the complexity and size of the project we will copy some files to your project that will assist with the building and testing of both the API and UI components.  Copy the files in the **C:\\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\\Scripts\\** folder to your **c:\\hol** folder.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution'
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\Scripts\*' -Destination 'c:\hol' -Force
    ```

    1. [] Your **c:\hol** directory contents should resemble the following:

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image8.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image8.png)

1. [] In your PowerShell window issue the following commands:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    .\stopApiandUI.ps1
    .\startApiandUI.ps1
    .\testAll.ps1
    ```

    >[!NOTE] These scripts do the following:
    >
    > **.\stopApiandUI.ps1**: This script will issue **docker stop** and **docker rm** to stop and remove all containers created by **.\startApiandUI.ps1**
    >
    > **.\startApiandUI.ps1**: This script will issue **docker-compose** using the dc.AllUp.yml file and create all the containers.  It will also issue Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet to verify that the REST API is accessible
    >
    > **.\testAll.ps1**: This script will issue the **dotnet test** command against the API and UI test projects
    >
    >**.\buildAll.ps1**: This script will issue the **dotnet build** command against all the projects in both solutions

1. [] Open your browser and navigate to +++http://localhost:9090/customers+++. You should receive the following web page:

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image9.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image9.png)

1. [] Stop all the running containers and clean up any unused docker images by using the following command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    .\stopApiAndUi.ps1
    ```

    >[!NOTE]This will be the process we use to build and run the application layers locally going forward.

    >[!KNOWLEDGE] We can test the API Layer separately. However, for us to test the user interface layer, we are **forced to have the whole system running**. Two additional layers. Let's try to understand why this is the case.

1. [] Open the **CustomersController.cs** class in the **ModernUIApp**.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image10.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image10.png)

1. [] Notice how the class constructor **CustomersController(IConfiguration configuration)** has a dependency on the API layer.  You can see that in this constructor, we must instantiate a new **HttpClient()** so we can call the API. This results in a I/O operation during the test.

    ```CustomersController.cs-nocopy
    public class CustomersController : Controller
        {
            private HttpClient _customersApiClient;
            private string _customerApiUrl;
            public CustomersController(IConfiguration configuration)
            {
                _customersApiClient = new HttpClient();
                _customerApiUrl =   configuration.GetValue<string>("ApiURL");
            }
            public IActionResult Index()
            {
                var customers = getCustomersFromApi();
                return View(customers);
            }
    ```

    >[!NOTE] There are few options on how to work around this, to make our code more testable.  We can mock the HTTP client, then mock the API call return, or refactor the code and abstract completely where the data is coming from. The class would depend on an interface rather than a concrete implementation. We would be using the following and using this design pattern: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern).  We will use the Bridge Pattern to make our code more testable.

1. [] Copy the **Services** directory from **C:\\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\\** to your **c:\\hol\\ModernUIAppSolution\\ModernUIApp\\** folder

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\Services' -Destination 'C:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution\ModernUIApp\' -Force -Recurse
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image11.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image11.png)

1. [] Copy the **CustomersController.cs** file from **C:\\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\\Controllers\\CustomersController.cs** to your **c:\\hol\\ModernUIAppSolution\\ModernUIApp\\** folder

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\Controllers\CustomersController.cs' -Destination 'C:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution\ModernUIApp\Controllers\' -Force
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image12.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image12.png)

1. [] Locate and open in Visual Studio Code the **Startup.cs** file in your **ModernUIApp** project.  We will add a "using" statement and a new line of code to the **ConfigureServices()** method in this file.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image15.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image15.png)

    1. [] Modify the code at the top of the file and add a new using statement after line 10:

    ```C#-linenums
    using ModernUIApp.Services;
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image14.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image14.png)

    1. [] Modify the **ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)** method and add the following line after line 27:

    ```C#-linenums
    services.AddScoped<ICustomerDataService, CustomerDataService>();
    ```
    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image16.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image16.png)

    >[!KNOWLEDGE] This line of code declares which implementation should be used in the UI project, for the **ICustomerDataService** interface. Obviously, we will want the real implementation in this case **CustomerDataService**. This means that any controller or class that has such a dependency can simply declare that it needs an **ICustomerDataService** and the application will figure out which implementation of that interface needs to be used.
    >
    This also allows us to swap the real implementation with a **mocked** one during our tests, removing the hard dependency.

1. [] Copy the **Mocks** directory from **C:\\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\\Mocks** to your **C:\\hol\\ModernUIAppSolution\\ModernUIApp.Tests** project folder.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\Mocks' -Destination 'C:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution\ModernUIApp.Tests\' -Force -Recurse
    ```

    !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image17.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image17.png)

1. [] Copy the **CustomersControllerTests.cs** file from the **C:\\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\\Tests\\** folder to your **c:\\hol\\ModernUIAppSolution\\ModernUIApp.Tests** project folder.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 03 - Shift-Left Testing\Exercise 4 - Designing for Testability\Tests\CustomersControllerTests.cs' -Destination 'C:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution\ModernUIApp.Tests\' -Force
    ```

1. [] Save all your changes and run the PowerShell utility scripts in your **c:\\hol** folder.  We will test with the application up first:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    .\stopApiandUI.ps1
    .\startApiandUI.ps1
    .\testAll.ps1
    ```

1. [] Stop all running containers and now issue the tests.  Notice how the tests still executed and passed with the database unavailable for the UI:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    .\stopApiandUI.ps1
    .\testAll.ps1
    ```

1. [] Commit any pending changes on main:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution'
    git add *
    git commit -m 'Created Mocks for UI'
    git push
    ```

    >[!NOTE] Note that we did not launch any of the applications to execute the tests. This was possible by removing the hard dependencies.
    >
   !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image18.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image18.png)
    >
    The Customers controller doesn't need to know where the data is coming from, it just declares that it need a data service.
    >
   !IMAGE[module2-lab3-exercise4-image19.png](module2-lab3-exercise4-image19.png)
    >
    The test class can then pass a **mocked** or **fake** data service, but still test the controller functionality.

# Exercise 1: Create a Feature Flag

### Introduction

Feature flags are an important DevOps technique that makes the process of continuous delivery easier. They help with the following aspects of the release process:

- Nearly eliminate integration (merge) conflicts.

- Toggle features to hide, disable, or enable features at run-time.

- Revert a change deployed to production without rolling back your release.

- Present users with variants of a feature, to determine which one performs better.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand and control feature flags to turn features on/off

### Prerequisites

1.  [Lab 1: Agile at Scale using Azure DevOps Services](#lab-1-agile-at-scale-using-azure-devops-services)
1.  [Lab 2: Source Control Management using Git](#lab-2-source-control-management-using-git)

### Tasks

Implementing feature flags can either be achieved by building your own infrastructure or by leveraging one of the many products in the marketplace. In this hands-on lab, we have chosen the latter. We will use a product called LaunchDarkly. **Our choice is not a recommendation of the product**. You should evaluate the solution that best meet your needs.

1. [] Navigate to +++https://launchdarkly.com+++ and click on the **Start Trial** button in the top-right to create your **free trial version**.  Once your trial is setup, return to the lab.

1. [] Return to the Web CRM Team board

    !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise1-image1.png](module2-lab4-exercise1-image1.png)

1. [] In the Backlog column, click on **+ New Item**, and create a work item titled +++Implement Customer Management Feature Flag+++

1. [] Move the **Implement Customer Management Feature Flag** work item to the Planned column.  It will be assigned to you and be set in the current sprint.

1. [] Move the **Implement Customer Management Feature Flag** work item to In Progress - Doing column.  This action communicates what work you are currently implementing.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Typically a team will decide on a work flow process that works for them.  In this method, we will *pull* work into *doing* and *push* completed work into *done*.  This allows for visual communication about what a team member has completed, but is waiting on a pull request to complete or a test to complete for the work item to finally be automatically moved into the Done column.

### Tasks

1. [] Copy the **ModernUIAppSolution** directory from **C:\\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\\Lab 04 - Feature Flags\\Exercise 2 - Use a Feature Flag in your Application\\** to your **c:\\hol** folder

    ```PowerShell-linnenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    Copy-Item -Path 'C:\DevOps Fundamentals Lab Material\Lab 04 - Feature Flags\Exercise 2 - Use a Feature Flag in your Application\ModernUIAppSolution' -Destination 'C:\hol' -Force -Recurse
    ```

1. [] Open a PowerShell window and go to the root folder containing both your **ModernApiAppSolution** and your **ModernUIAppSolution** directories.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    ```

1. [] Use the following command to open Visual Studio Code in the **c:\\hol** directory

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Code .
    ```

1. [] In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the **ModernUIAppSolution** folder and open the **ui.Dockerfile** file.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise2-image1.png](module2-lab4-exercise2-image1.png)

    1. [] Add the +++**ENV LaunchDarklyKey**+++ environment variable with the key copied from exercise 1, step 16:
    
        !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise2-image2.png](module2-lab4-exercise2-image2.png)

    1. [] In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the **ModernUIApp** folder and open the **CustomersController.cs** file.  Change line 19 and use the email address you used to create your free trial at launchdarkly.com.

        !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise2-image3.png](module2-lab4-exercise2-image3.png)

1. [] Run the following commands to stop any running containers and start the application:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    .\stopApiandUi.ps1
    .\startApiandUI.ps1
    ```

1. [] Once the application is available, navigate to +++http://localhost:9090/Customers+++, you will see the list of customers.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise2-image4.png](module2-lab4-exercise2-image4.png)

1. [] Return to launchdarkly.com, sign in, and navigate to the feature flag dashboard, and turn off your feature flag.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise2-image5.png](module2-lab4-exercise2-image5.png)

1. [] Refresh the customers page in your application. You should now get the following response.

    !IMAGE[module2-lab4-exercise2-image6.png](module2-lab4-exercise2-image6.png)

    >[!NOTE] You are now able to control the visibility of this feature directly from the launch darkly site by targeting specific users.  If this feature incurs errors, you would collect telemetry data from it, and turn the feature off.  In this way, you have the ability to setup and run experiments, fail-fast on those experiments, and learn from them to introduce greater value.

1. [] Examine the code responsible of enabling the feature flag on and off. It is in the **CustomersController.cs** class in the **ModernUIApp** application.
    
    ```CustomersController.cs-nocopy
        public CustomersController(ICustomerDataService customerDataService, IFeatureFlagService featureFlagService)
        {
            _customerDataService = customerDataService;
            _featureFlagService = featureFlagService;
        }
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if (_featureFlagService.ViewFeature(_userName))
            {
                var customers = _customerDataService.GetAll();
                return View(customers);
            }
            else
            {
                return View("~/Views/ComingSoon/Index.cshtml");
            }
        }
    ```

1. [] Stop and remove your Docker containers.

    1. [] Stop all running Docker containers

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    .\stopApiandUi.ps1
    ```

1. [] From your PowerShell session, stage, commit, and push your changes:

    1. [] Stage your changes in Git using:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUIAppSolution'
        git add *
        ```
    1. [] Commit the changes to the topic branch:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git commit -m 'Created Customers Management Feature Flag'
        ```

    1. [] Push the changes to the remote topic branch:

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git push
        ```

1. [] We have tested our feature flag.  Keeping to our work item workflow, return to Azure DevOps Services and *push* your work item into **In Progress - Done** column.

# Lab 5: Continuous Integration

### Introduction

The build phase of the application lifecycle is about making sure the application is continuously ready to be shipped. It is also about making it ready to be shipped. Therefore, the way you build it will depend on how you want to ship it.

We are going to use the following services to host our application.

- The **ModernApiApp** will be hosted in an **Azure Container Instance**

- The **ModernApi.Database** database will be hosted in a **SQL Azure** database

- The **ModernUIApp** will be hosted in an **Azure Container Instance**

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Learn how to setup an automated build definition in Azure DevOps Services

- Understand the value of topic, pull, and main build definitions

# Exercise 1: Prepare the Infrastructure for Development and Test 

### Introduction

In previous labs, our strategy has been to create a topic branch for each story that your team is currently working on, and then to merge those branches back to the main branch as soon as work is done on the topic. However, topic branches should be short lived to minimize integration debt.

Defining what it means to be done with a story, will be up to your team. Whatever definition you come to agreement on, you will want to automate its verification as part of the build process.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a topic build definition

### Tasks

1. [] Open a PowerShell window and type the following Azure CLI command.  This will log your PowerShell session in with Azure so you can continue to work in PowerShell and create resources in Azure:
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    az login -u '@lab.CloudPortalCredential(Student1).Username' -p '@lab.CloudPortalCredential(Student1).Password'
    ```

    !IMAGE[module3-lab5-exercise1-image1.png](module3-lab5-exercise1-image1.png)

1. [] We will create a few PowerShell variables that will help us create and prepare the infrastructure in Azure:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $suffix = '@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $resourcegroup = 'holDevTestRGlod@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $acr = 'acrlod@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $acrlogin = $acr + '.azurecr.io'
    ```

    !IMAGE[module3-lab5-exercise1-image2.png](module3-lab5-exercise1-image2.png)

1. [] We will create an **Azure Container Registry**. This registry will be used to store all the Docker images you will create during your development and test cycles:
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az acr create -n $acr -g $resourcegroup --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
    ```

1. [] After a few moments, you will return to your PowerShell prompt.  Login to the **Azure Container Registry** you just created.

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az acr login -n $acr
    ```

### Introduction

Continuous delivery (CD) is the process to build, test, configure and deploy from a build to production environment. In this lab, we'll be deploying our application manually, then we will automate the manual process. By automation, CD reduces the total time to deploy, time to mitigate (TTM), and time to remediate (TTR). This optimizes process time and eliminates idle time.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Setup an automated release pipeline

- Create various environments for your pipeline

- Set up a resource group on Azure

- Deploy your application to a web service and view it in a web browser

- Use feature switches to toggle between showing and hiding features

### Tasks

1. [] Open a PowerShell session and set the following variables.  We will use these variables through the remaining steps of this lab to assist with the execution of our AZ CLI commands:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol'
    $resourcegroup = 'holDevTestRGlod@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $acr = 'acrlod@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $acrlogin = $acr + '.azurecr.io'
    $apiname = 'modernapiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $apidns = 'modernapiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $uiname  = 'modernuiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $uidns = 'modernuiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $sqlserver = 'modernsqlserver-@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $db = 'modernsqlserverdb-@lab.LabInstance.Id'
    $sqluser = 'devopsadmin'
    $sqlpass = 'Microsoft2018!1'
    $location = 'eastus'
    ```

1. [] Execute the following command to login to your Azure subscription:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az login -u '@lab.CloudPortalCredential(Student1).Username' -p '@lab.CloudPortalCredential(Student1).Password'
    ```
    >[!NOTE]This command will return information about your azure subscription.

    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image1.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image1.png)

1. [] Next we will create a Azure hosted SQL Server to host your database for the REST API.  Execute the following **AZ SQL SERVER CREATE** statement:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az sql server create --name $sqlserver --resource-group $resourcegroup --location $location --admin-user $sqluser --admin-password $sqlpass
    ```

1. [] To access the SQL Server, we need to create a firewall rule to allow connecting to the database. Execute the following **AZ SQL SERVER FIREWALL-RULE CREATE** statement:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group $resourcegroup --server $sqlserver -n AllowLODSystem --start-ip-address '0.0.0.0' --end-ip-address '255.255.255.255'
    ```

1. [] Create a database on the hosted SQL Server for the REST API.  Execute the **AZ SQL DB CREATE** statement:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az sql db create --resource-group $resourcegroup --server $sqlserver --name $db --service-objective S0 
    ```

1. [] Use the following command to get the connection string for your database.  We will use this for the REST API and set it as an environment variable for the REST API.  Execute the **AZ SQL DB SHOW-CONNECTION-STRING** statement:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $cxn = az sql db show-connection-string --server $sqlserver --name $db --client ado.net 
    ```

1. [] The username and password currently in the connection string are the string literal "username" and "password".  Replace "username" and "password" in the connection string:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $cxn = $cxn.Replace('<username>',$sqluser)
    $cxn = $cxn.Replace('<password>',$sqlpass)
    ```

1. [] Navigate to your resource group in Azure Portal.  You will see your ACR, SQL Server, and SQL Database:

    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image2.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image2.png)

1. [] Click on **modernsqlserverdb-@lab.LabInstance.Id (modernsqlserver-@lab.LabInstance.Id/modernsqlserverdb-@lab.LabInstance.Id** in your list, then click on **Query editor (preview)** in the left navigate pane:

    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image3.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image3.png)

1. [] Provide the SQL Authentication credentials to log into your database:

    1. [] Username: +++devopsadmin+++   
    
    1. [] Password: +++Microsoft2018!1+++

    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image4.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image4.png)

1. [] You will be presented with a new query window.  In this window we will create a new table and populate that table with data for the REST API.

    ```TSQL-linenums
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Customers] (
        [Id] int identity not null primary key,
        [Address] nvarchar(128) not null,
        [CompanyName] nvarchar(128) not null,
        [Name] nvarchar(128) not null
    );
    GO

    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'100 Main Street', N'Microsoft', N'Scott X. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'200 Contoso Way', N'Microsoft', N'Kathleen Y. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'300 Fabrikam Ct.', N'Microsoft', N'Judson Z. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'400 Northwind Trader Circle', N'Microsoft', N'Amy W. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'500 World Wide Street', N'Microsoft', N'Jean-Phillip V. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'600 Main Street', N'Microsoft', N'Bill X. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'700 Contoso Way', N'Microsoft', N'Satya Y. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'800 Fabrikam Ct.', N'Microsoft', N'Brad Z. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'900 Northwind Trader Circle', N'Microsoft', N'Chris W. Doe')
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customers] ([Address], [CompanyName], [Name]) VALUES (N'1000 World Wide Street', N'Microsoft', N'Kurt V. Doe')
    GO
    ```

    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image5.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image5.png)

1. [] Close the Query editor by clicking on the **X** in the top right, then click on ok in the dialog box about saving changes.  You don't need to save these changes.

    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image6.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image6.png)

1. [] Return to your PowerShell session and retrieve the Azure Container Registry username. Execute the **AZ ACR CREDENTIAL SHOW** command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $acruser = az acr credential show -n $acr --query username 
    ```
    >[!TIP] This value is: acrlod@lab.LabInstance.Id

1. [] Retrieve the Azure Container Registry password.  Execute the **AZ ACR CREDENTIAL SHOW** command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $acrpass = az acr credential show -n $acr --query passwords[0].value
    ```
    >[!TIP] This value will be dynamic and a long complicated string

1. [] Retrieve the container registry login server url. Execute the **AZ ACR SHOW** command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $acrlogin = az acr show --name $acr --query loginServer
    ```
    >[!TIP] This value is: acrlod@lab.LabInstance.Id.azurecr.io and the text loginServer is case sensitive.  Server must have an uppercase S and the rest lowercase.

1. [] We are ready to create our serverless container by pulling an image from your ACR.  Create an Azure Container Instance that will host your modernapiapp.  Execute the **AZ CONTAINER CREATE** command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
az container create --resource-group $resourcegroup --name $apiname --image $acrlogin/modernapi:Latest --os-type Windows --cpu 2 --memory 3.5 --registry-login-server $acrlogin --registry-username $acruser --registry-password $acrpass --dns-name-label $apidns --ports 80 --environment-variables "ModernApiDBConnectionString=$cxn"
    ```

    >[!NOTE] "ModernApiDBConnectionString" must be in double-quotes and not single quotes.  This allows for variable expansion within PowerShell.  All single quoted strings in PowerShell are literal; however, with double-quoted strings PowerShell will expand the variable with its assigned value.

1. [] Retrieve the API URL and set it to a PowerShell variable.  We will use this for the UI as an environment variable.
    
    ```PowerShell-linenums
    $apiurl = "http://$apiname.$location.azurecontainer.io/api/customers"
    ```

1. [] Create an Azure Container Instance application that will host your modernuiapp.  We will pull from the modernui repository in your ACR to deploy this container.  Execute the **AZ CONTAINER CREATE** command:

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    az container create --resource-group $resourcegroup --name $uiname --image $acrlogin/modernui:Latest --os-type Windows --cpu 2 --memory 3.5 --registry-login-server $acrlogin --registry-username $acruser --registry-password $acrpass --dns-name-label $uidns --ports 80 --environment-variables "ApiURL=$apiurl"
    ```

1. [] Test your API and UI container deployments:

    1. [] Verify the REST API container is responsive by requesting the **/weatherforecast** route.  This is part of the dotnet new webapi project creation command and will serve as a good testing point.

    ```Browser-linenums
    http://modernapiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id.eastus.azurecontainer.io/weatherforecast
    ```
    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image7.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image7.png)

    1. [] Verify the REST API container is returning data by requesting the **/api/customers** route.  This will also test the connection from the REST API to the SQL Server and the SQL Server access and data.

    ```Browser-linenums
    http://modernapiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id.eastus.azurecontainer.io/api/customers
    ```
    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image8.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image8.png)

    1. [] Verify the UI is up by requesting the **default page**.  This will test that the UI web server, called Kestrel, is up and awaiting web requests.

    ```Browser-linenums
    http://modernuiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id.eastus.azurecontainer.io
    ```
    !IMAGE[module3-lab6-exercise1-image9.png](module3-lab6-exercise1-image9.png)

    >[!NOTE] Learn more about Kestrel by navigating to [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

    1. [] Verify the application is fully responsive by requesting the **/Customers** page from the UI, in turn then calls the REST API URL which will query SQL Sever and return the data as JSON to the UI.

    ```Browser
    http://modernuiapp-@lab.LabInstance.Id.eastus.azurecontainer.io/Customers
    ```

# Exercise 2: Manage Infrastructure as Code

### Introduction
Now that we have deployed the application manually, we can take the next step and automate the process.  We do this to ensure a consistent environment each time we create a build.  Additionally, with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) we gain visibility, traceability, and agility with source control on changes to the environment.  For example, to change our database plan we create a work item, go through our process and change the argument from S0 to S1 and deploy our infrastructure.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage your application infrastructure as code, and 

- store your application infrastructure code in a git repository.

# Exercise 4: Create the Application Release Pipeline

### Introduction
Here we will create the Release pipeline using YAML.  YAML allows for source control integration and resembles the classic release pipeline with jobs and tasks.  This pipeline will creat the CD methodology: Ring Deployment and setup Ring 0 and Ring 1 for your application.  Each step of the way, unit tests are being executing and Web Tests are being executed.

### Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to

- create a new release pipeline using an existing yml file,

- review the ring deployment methodology in practice, and

- verify your application is operational by conducting a test during the pipeline execution.

    git add *
    git commit -m "Added Telemetry to the REST API"
    git push
    ```

    > [!NOTE] This will trigger your **modernapi.main** build pipeline and create a new image which will be deployed to your ACR in Azure

1. [] Now stage and commit the changes in the **ModernUiAppSolution**

    ```PowerShell-linenums
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUiAppSolution'
    git add *
    git commit -m "Added Telemetry to the UI"
    git push
    ```

    > [!NOTE] This will NOT trigger your **modernui.main** build pipeline.  We must submit a new Pull Request which will then merge these changes to the ModernUI to its main branch.  Then the .yml build will trigger and a new image will be deployed to your ACR.

1. [] We have tested our telemetry data in the REST API and the UI.  Keeping to our work item workflow, return to Azure DevOps Services and *push* your work item into **In Progress - Done** column.  This signals that you have completed this action and are now waiting for tests, pull requests, or other actions that will move your work item to Done.

    !IMAGE[module4-lab7-exercise2-image15.png](module4-lab7-exercise2-image15.png)

1. [] Create a new pull request for your changes. In Azure DevOps Services, click on **Repos** section then click on Files.  Click on **Create a pull request** button to start the process, then click on the **Create** button in the next page.

1. [] Complete the pull request by clicking on **Approve**, then **Complete** to merge the changes to the main branch.  By clicking on **Approve** then **Complete** you are acting as a peer reviewer or code reviewer.  This action also moves your work item into the Done column on your board.

1. [] Clean up your local branches after you complete the pull request

    1. [] Switch from your local branch to your main branch.
    
        ```PowerShell-linenums
        Set-Location -Path 'c:\hol\ModernUiAppSolution'
        git checkout main
        ```

    1. [] At this point all your work has been on the topic branch which has now been merged into the remote main branch.  Your local main branch is now behind the remote main branch.  You must *pull* the changes that have been merged into the remote main to your local main.

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git pull
        ```
    
    1. [] Delete your local branch

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git branch -d topics/tb-###
        ```
        > [!ALERT] Use your topic branch number.  ### will be the work item ID.
    
    1. [] Delete your remote tracking

        ```PowerShell-linenums
        git branch -dr origin/topics/tb-##
